## Help Out
I would love to see multiple programmers help out with the project. There are many integration that can be added with the CloudPanel 3.1+. Designing the application with NancyFx you can submit POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests to perform any action that CloudPanel does behind the scenes. Some of the things that are needed most of all are:

* Localization
* Bug Reports
* Quality
* AD Sync tool to sync local domain accounts with cloud domain accounts
